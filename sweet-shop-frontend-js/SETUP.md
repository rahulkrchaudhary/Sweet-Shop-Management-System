## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. Your Spring Boot backend should be running on `http://localhost:9090`
2. Node.js should be installed

### Steps
1. The React app is already starting (you should see "Starting the development server..." in terminal)
2. Once started, open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You'll see the home page with login/registration options

## 🔧 Backend Integration

The frontend is configured to work with your existing API endpoints:

- **POST** `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- **POST** `/api/auth/login` - User login  
- **GET** `/api/sweets` - Get all sweets
- **GET** `/api/sweets/search` - Search with filters

## 📱 User Flow

1. **Start**: User lands on home page
2. **Authentication**: Click Login/Register buttons to authenticate
3. **Browse**: After login, click "Browse Sweets" or "Start Shopping"
4. **Filter**: Use left sidebar to filter by category
5. **Search**: Use search bar to find specific sweets
6. **Price Filter**: Set min/max price ranges
7. **Add to Cart**: Click "Add to Cart" on sweet cards
8. **Cart Management**: Cart appears at top with all selected items
9. **Purchase**: Click "Buy Now" to complete purchase
10. **Cart Clear**: Cart disappears after successful purchase

## 🎨 Design Features

## 🔒 Security Features

- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token attachment to requests
- Protected routes requiring authentication
- Auto-logout on token expiry
- Secure API communication

## 🌟 Additional Features

- **Cart Persistence**: Cart state maintained during session
- **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering as you type
- **Stock Validation**: Prevents adding out-of-stock items
- **Quantity Controls**: Increase/decrease item quantities
- **Price Display**: Indian Rupee (₹) currency format
- **Category Management**: Dynamic category extraction
- **Responsive Grids**: Adaptive layouts for all screen sizes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Backend not running**: Make sure your Spring Boot API is running on port 9090
2. **CORS errors**: Your backend should allow requests from localhost:3000
3. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` if packages are missing
4. **Port conflicts**: React will prompt to use a different port if 3000 is busy

Your React frontend is now fully functional and ready to interact with your backend API! 🎊
